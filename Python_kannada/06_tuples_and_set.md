# Tuples and Sets in Python

## 1. Tuples in Python

A **tuple** is a collection of items that is **ordered** and **immutable** (unchangeable).  
Tuples are similar to lists, but once a tuple is created, you cannot modify it.  
They are often used to group related data together.

### Syntax
```python
my_tuple = (element1, element2, element3, ...)
```

### Example
```python
my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
numbers_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

### Creating a Tuple with One Element
To create a tuple with only one element, include a trailing comma:
```python
single_element_tuple = ("apple",)
```
