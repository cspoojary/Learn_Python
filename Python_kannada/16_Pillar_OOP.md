# The Four Pillars of OOP
## 1. Encapsulation
- Definition: Encapsulation involves wrapping data and methods that operate on that data within one unit, such as a class. This protects the data from external interference and misuse, improving security and maintainability.
- Real-World Example: Imagine an ATM machine—you interact with a limited interface (e.g., withdraw, deposit, check balance) but do not have access to the inner mechanics or backend functions.
