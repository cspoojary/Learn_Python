# Menu-Driven Programs in Python

## Introduction
- A menu-driven program is a program that allows users to interact by choosing options from a menu.
- These programs are commonly used in applications such as banking systems, shopping carts, or command-line utilities.
- Menu-driven programs are typically implemented using loops and conditional statements (if-elif-else).

## Why Use Menu-Driven Programs?
1. Interactive: Provides a user-friendly way to interact with programs.
2. Reusable: Can be easily modified or extended by adding new menu options.
3. Efficient: Reduces the need for users to remember commands by presenting them with a list of options.
