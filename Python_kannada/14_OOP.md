## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
- OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
- It allows for better modularity and code reusability by creating objects that model real-world entities.
- Procedural vs Object-Oriented Programming:
Procedural Programming: Based on functions, where the main focus is on performing actions.
    - Example: Writing multiple functions to process data.
- Object-Oriented Programming: Based on objects and classes. The main focus is on objects (data) and the methods (functions) that manipulate this data.
