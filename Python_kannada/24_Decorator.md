# Decorators in Python
Decorators allow us to modify the behavior of a function without changing its actual code.

Think of it like wrapping a dosa with chutney — dosa (function) remains the same, but the outer layer (decorator) changes how it tastes (behaves)!
## 📌 Why Use Decorators?
- To add extra functionality to existing functions
- Used in logging, timing, authentication, access control, etc.
- Helps write clean and reusable code
