# Decorators in Python
Decorators allow us to modify the behavior of a function without changing its actual code.

Think of it like wrapping a dosa with chutney — dosa (function) remains the same, but the outer layer (decorator) changes how it tastes (behaves)!

## 📌 Why Use Decorators?
- To add extra functionality to existing functions
- Used in logging, timing, authentication, access control, etc.
- Helps write clean and reusable code

## ✅ Functions are First-Class Citizens in Python
This means:
1. You can pass functions as arguments
2. You can return functions from other functions
3. You can store them in variables
4. 
## ⭐ @decorator Syntax
