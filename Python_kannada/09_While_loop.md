## 1. Basic Structure of a while Loop

The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the condition is `True`.

**Syntax:**
```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute as long as condition is True
```

**Example:**
```python
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
