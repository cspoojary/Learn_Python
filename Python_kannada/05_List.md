# Lists in Python

## 1. What is a List?
A **list** is a collection of items that are **ordered**, **mutable** (changeable), and allow **duplicate elements**.  
Lists can hold items of different data types, such as integers, strings, or even other lists.

### Syntax:
```python
my_list = [element1, element2, element3, ...]
```
### Example
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = ["apple", 3, True]
```
