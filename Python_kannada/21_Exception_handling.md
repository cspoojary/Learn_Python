# Errors and Exception Handling in Python

## What is an Error?
- An error is a problem in a program that stops the execution.
- Errors can happen due to:
  - Wrong code
  - Unexpected input
  - External factors (like missing files, network issues)
## Two Types of Errors in Python
|Type |	Meaning|
|Syntax Errors |	Mistakes in the code structure (missing colon, brackets, etc.)|
|Exceptions |	Errors that happen during execution (e.g., divide by zero)|
