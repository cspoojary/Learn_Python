# OOP Challenges

## 1. Banking System Simulation
Design a system to simulate a bank's operations, where users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their account balance.
  - Extend functionality to include multiple account types (e.g., savings, current) with unique behaviors like interest calculation or overdraft limits.
  - Emphasize encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

## 2. Library Management System
Create a library system that keeps track of books, borrowers, and availability. Allow borrowing, returning, and viewing available books.
  - Include due dates, penalties for late returns, and unique IDs for books and users.
  - Focus on class relationships and method responsibilities.

## 3. Hospital Patient Management
Create a hospital management system that tracks doctors, patients, and appointments.
  - Doctors can have specialties, and patients may have different ailments.
  - Each appointment should store the doctor-patient relationship, along with the date and time.
  - Add functionality for doctors' schedules and ensuring no double booking.

## 4. E-Commerce Platform Prototype
Simulate a basic e-commerce platform where customers can browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders.
  - Use OOP principles to manage inventory, pricing (e.g., discounts), and order tracking.
  - Integrate functionality for calculating taxes and shipping costs dynamically.
