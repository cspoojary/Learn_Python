# OOP Challenges

## 1. Banking System Simulation
Design a system to simulate a bank's operations, where users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their account balance.
  - Extend functionality to include multiple account types (e.g., savings, current) with unique behaviors like interest calculation or overdraft limits.
  - Emphasize encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

## 2. Library Management System
Create a library system that keeps track of books, borrowers, and availability. Allow borrowing, returning, and viewing available books.
  - Include due dates, penalties for late returns, and unique IDs for books and users.
  - Focus on class relationships and method responsibilities.
