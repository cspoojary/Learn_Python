# Conditional Statements in Python: if, elif, and else

In programming, conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to allow your program to make decisions.

## 1. The if Statement

The `if` statement is used to test a condition. If the condition is `True`, the block of code under the `if` statement is executed.

### Syntax:
```python
if condition:
    # Code block to execute if the condition is True
```
