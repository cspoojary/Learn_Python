# File Handling in Python
File handling allows us to read from and write to files — a common task in almost every real-world application (storing data, logs, reports, etc.).
# 📁 Why File Handling?
- To save user data permanently (like notes, records, etc.)
- To read content from a file (like student marks, exam results)
- Helps build real applications like:
  - Address books
Billing systems
Exam report generators
